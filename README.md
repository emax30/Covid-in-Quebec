# Covid-in-Quebec
Analysis of the effects of lockdowns and school reopening on the number of Covid cases in Quebec.

The regression discontinuity design (RDD) method was used to analyze the effect of the following events on the number of Covid cases in Quebec in 2020-2021: the first lockdown (20/3/2020), the reopening of schools (31/8/2020), and the second lockdown (25/12/2020). The results were visualized using matplotlib.
